# Prototype Patter #
* Complicated object (e.g. cars) aren't designed from scratch
  * They reiterate existing designs
* An existing (partially or fully constructed) design is a Prototype
* We make a copy (clone) the prototype and customize it
  * Requires 'deep copy' support
* We make this cloning convenient (e.g. via a Factory)
  ***A partially or fully initialized object that you copy (clone) and make use of.***
